# What are React Hooks?
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.</li>
    <li>If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.</li>
    <li>Can be custom written </li>
    <li>Are available now for React Web, and will be available in the next React Native release!</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

## Old code like this:

```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
---
## Can be translated into this:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---
## Declaring a State Variable:
In a class, we initialize the count state to 0 by setting this.state to { count: 0 } in the constructor:
```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
```
---
## Declaring a State Variable:
In a function component, we have no this, so we can’t assign or read this.state. Instead, we call the useState Hook directly inside our component:
```jsx
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
---
## What does calling useState do? 
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>It declares a “state variable”.</li>
    <li>Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else.</li>
    <li>It allows us to store state for our component, similar to this.state does for class component.</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
## What does useState return?
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it.</li>
    <li>This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState().</li>
    <li>This is similar to this.state.count and this.setState in a class, except you get them in a pair.</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
## What do we pass to useState as an argument?
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state</li>
    <li>Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if that’s all we need.</li>
    <li>In our example, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable.</li>
    <li>If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice.</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
In a function component, we have no this, so we can’t assign or read this.state. Instead, we call the useState Hook directly inside our component:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
We declare a state variable called count, and set it to 0. React will remember its current value between re-renders, and provide the most recent one to our function. If we want to update the current count, we can call setCount.
---
# Reading State:
When we want to display the current co unt in a class, we read this.state.count:
```jsx
<p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
```
---
# Reading State:
In a function, we can use count directly:
```jsx
<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
```
---
# Updating State:
In a class, we need to call this.setState() to update the count state:
```jsx
<button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
  Click me
</button>
  ```
---
## Updating State:
In a function, we already have setCount and count as variables so we don’t need this:
```jsx
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
  Click me
</button>
```
---
## Recap:
Let’s now recap what we learned line by line and check our understanding.
```jsx
 1:  import React, { useState } from 'react';
 2:
 3:  function Example() {
 4:    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 5:
 6:    return (
 7:      <div>
 8:        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
 9:        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
10:         Click me
11:        </button>
12:      </div>
13:    );
14:  }
```
---
## Using multiple:
```jsx
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
  ...
```
---
The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:
```jsx
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---
Note how we have to duplicate the code between these two lifecycle methods in class.
```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
}
```
---
But using useEffect we can simply write this as:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
});
```
---
## What does useEffect do? 
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render</li>
    <li>React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates</li>
    <li>In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other API</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
## Why is useEffect called inside a component?
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect</li>
    <li>We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope</li>
    <li>Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
## Does useEffect run after every render?
<ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update</li>
    <li>Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
# Conclusion
React Hooks are not really new feature that popped out just now. They are another (better ❓) way of doing React components that need to have state and/or lifecycle methods. Actually, they use the same internal logic that is being used currently by the class components.
